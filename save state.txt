After you've completed all the configuration steps and your virtual machine is in the desired state for evaluation:

In VirtualBox, select your virtual machine.
Instead of shutting down normally, use the "Save State" option. You can do this by:
a) Clicking on "Machine" in the VirtualBox menu, then "Save State"
b) Or using the shortcut Ctrl+S (on Windows/Linux) or Cmd+S (on Mac)


This will preserve the exact state of your virtual machine, including all running processes and open applications.
When you need to resume work or prepare for evaluation, simply start the VM, and it will return to exactly the same state it was in when you saved it.
For the evaluation, you should provide the signature of this saved state. The process to get the signature remains the same as described in the PDF:

Navigate to the VirtualBox VMs folder
Find your VM's .vdi file
Generate a SHA1 hash of this file


Save this hash in the signature.txt file in your Git repository.

Using save state ensures that your VM remains in a consistent state for all evaluations, preventing any unintended changes that might occur during normal shutdown and startup processes.
Thank you for pointing this out. It's a crucial step for ensuring consistent evaluation of your project.
