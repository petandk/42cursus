Certainly! I'll provide a step-by-step guide to complete the Born2beRoot exercise using VirtualBox and Debian. This guide will cover the main requirements of the project:

Set up VirtualBox and Debian:

Download and install VirtualBox from the official website
Download the latest stable Debian ISO


Create a new virtual machine:

Open VirtualBox and click "New"
Name it yourusername42 (e.g., john42)
Choose Linux as the type and Debian as the version
Allocate at least 1024MB of RAM
Create a new virtual hard disk (VDI, dynamically allocated, at least 8GB)


Configure the virtual machine:

Go to Settings > Network and set the adapter to Bridged
Mount the Debian ISO in Settings > Storage


Install Debian:

Start the VM and boot from the Debian ISO
Choose "Install" (not graphical install)
Follow the installation prompts, selecting your language, location, and keyboard layout


Partition the disk:

Choose "Manual" partitioning
Create two encrypted partitions using LVM:
a. Create a 500MB /boot partition (not encrypted)
b. Create an encrypted partition with the remaining space
c. Set up LVM within the encrypted partition
d. Create logical volumes for root, swap, home, var, srv, tmp, and var/log


Complete the Debian installation:

Install the GRUB boot loader
Complete the installation and reboot


Configure SSH:

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

Change the port to 4242
Disable root login


Restart the SSH service


Set up UFW firewall:

Install UFW: sudo apt install ufw
Enable UFW: sudo ufw enable
Allow port 4242: sudo ufw allow 4242


Configure password policy:

Edit /etc/login.defs:

Set PASS_MAX_DAYS to 30
Set PASS_MIN_DAYS to 2
Set PASS_WARN_AGE to 7


Install libpam-pwquality: sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
Edit /etc/security/pwquality.conf:

Set minlen to 10
Set ucredit to -1
Set dcredit to -1
Set maxrepeat to 3
Set usercheck to 1
Set difok to 7


Apply changes to existing users


Set up sudo:

Install sudo: sudo apt install sudo
Configure sudo:

Run sudo visudo
Add the following lines:
Defaults        passwd_tries=3
Defaults        badpass_message="Custom error message"
Defaults        logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"
Defaults        log_input,log_output
Defaults        requiretty
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"





Create user and groups:

Create user42 group: sudo groupadd user42
Create a user with your login: sudo adduser yourusername
Add the user to user42 and sudo groups:
sudo usermod -aG user42,sudo yourusername


Create the monitoring script:

Create a file named monitoring.sh in /root/
Write the script to display the required information
Make the script executable: sudo chmod +x /root/monitoring.sh


Set up cron job:

Edit the crontab: sudo crontab -e
Add the line: */10 * * * * /root/monitoring.sh | wall


Finalize and test:

Reboot the system
Test SSH connection from host machine
Verify all requirements are met



Remember to document your steps and be prepared to explain your choices during the defense. This guide covers the main requirements, but make sure to read the full project description for any additional details or specific instructions.
